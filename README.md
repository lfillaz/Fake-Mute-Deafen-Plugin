A custom BetterDiscord plugin that adds a toggleable fake mute/deafen button. When active, the button displays a red or green icon indicating the status of the feature. This plugin was Redevelopment by [lfillaz](https://github.com/lfillaz).

## Features

- **Toggle Button**: Easily turn the fake mute/deafen feature on or off with a single click.
- **Visual Indicator**: The button changes color to indicate the feature's status:
  - **Green**: Feature is enabled (fake mute/deafen is active).
  - **Red**: Feature is disabled.
- **Seamless Integration**: The button is styled to look native within the Discord UI and appears alongside the microphone button.

1. **Before activating the plugin**, manually click the **mute** and **deafen** buttons in Discord to enable both modes.
2. Once muted and deafened, click the new toggle button added by the plugin to activate the fake mute/deafen feature.
